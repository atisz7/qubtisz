Hello, my name is Attila. I was born and raised in a loving family in Slovakia. I hold a Master of Science in Technical Informatics from Budapest University of Technology and Economics, where I developed a deep passion for technology, systems thinking, and elegant problem-solving.

Professionally, I have spent the past decade working in the IT departments of leading U.S.-based S&P 500 financial institutions, with a focus on:

- DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- IT Operations & Infrastructure Automation
- Monitoring & Observability Solutions
- Resilience Engineering & Continuous Improvement

I'm a husband and proud father of two children, and I believe in lifelong learning, balance, and building systems that are not just functional — but reliable, scalable, and meaningful.

Thank you for visiting!
